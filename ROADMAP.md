Roadmap
=======

v1.0.0 Beta Milestone
---------------------

Since the start of the project we've been through some major refactors in
order to achieve the desired stack and experience to finally have a first stable
release.

We've changed from a RESTful API into a GraphQL API, while also changing the data
architecture in the front end to include Redux.

Our first dashboard was also not designed at all because our focus was mainly on
the page builder. We're now finally tuning up the entire admin experience
so that we can make it as relaxed as possible.

Below you can find the major things that are still in the road we're going through to
reach the beta release, there are of course other minor issues that can be found
